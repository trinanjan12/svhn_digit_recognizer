    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: Create a solution to read house numbers in the 100 images attached (testsvhn.zip) using deep learning/ machine learning. You can use the full SVHN dataset (http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) for training purposes. You can use the machine learning framework of your choice. You don't have to train models for very long - a high or low accuracy will not determine our review of your solution. You can use any existing open source implementation as well, and don't have to implement your solution from scratch, if it helps. You can also use pre-trained models as a starting point for your training, if you wish.     \n",

    "Please Add below Listed Execution files to be included in the test Project.\n",
    "   \"Please have a few more examples such as **test82.png, test36.png, test70.png, test10.png** for us to get a sense of his hands-on experience. If there's a new project zip he can submit taking this into consideration, would be good to get a sense of the ideas and thought process"
